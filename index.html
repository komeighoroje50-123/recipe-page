      <li>Total: Approximately 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Preparation: 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Cooking: 5 minutes</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
      <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
      You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
    
      <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
    
      <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure.</li>
      the eggs evenly coat the surface.
    
      <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
      middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
    
      <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
      fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
